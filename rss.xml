Martin and Sally R. Osberg. A few chapters in and its a great read.</p>,<p>One section in the introduction really resonated with me and I thought worth sharing here as its relevance to our today is beyond the Social Entrepreneurship topic. It's about Equilibriums... and how to break them:</p>]]></description>

No one can stand by an argument saying everything is going swimmingly but its the tone of the arguments I am most confused by. We seem to have left logic and reason behind and in some areas are rewarding aggressive behaviour and soundbites. Behind this I think we’ve, again, lost something of our morals.</p>,<p>I started to really think about this after I left Wood Mackenzie. When I left there was a leaving card, a few drinks, and a goodbye speech. It was all rather humbling and during all of this someone said to me they were losing a Moral Compass. I remember feeling very touched and a little embarrassed at that point. The evening moved on with a few more drinks and silliness but something kept niggling me about the term.</p>]]></description>

The premise of the program is:</p>,<blockquote>As digital technologies continue to transform the marketplace, companies across the globe are collecting an enormous amount of data. Unfortunately, many of these same businesses lack the talent and structure to turn big data into a competitive advantage.</blockquote>,<p>The first question I have is how do businesses currently think of this? Is big data an opportunity or a curse? I'm on the side of the opportunity and a <a href="https://twitter.com/PracticalActs/status/730599085900767232">twitter poll agreed</a>. However, it’s worth considering as there are countless examples of where reading data wrongly has driven the wrong decisions. </p>]]></description>

Our pictures can be airbrushed, “facts” are single sourced to use on one side of the argument, snap polls are treated as gospel, and the distance between jealousy and ridicule too close.</p>,<p>But what has all of that got to do with Digital Transformation? Digital seems to be the great promise of the moment for so many businesses and organisations as they look for opportunities to grow. But too often Digital programs seem to jump to an end game before any transformation has happened. A significant program is designed and an end to end project plan put into action. For a tiny percentile it all works out and the beauty of a solution shines through. But for most more money is spent, teams are disrupted, results are not achieved and disillusionment sets in. Promise to failure and nothing in between.</p>]]></description>

Through Sport</h1>,<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dae9da35-82de-4167-8c58-d9608925af39.png">,<p>So much of our ability to do more seems to me to stem from the influence of those around us - our communities... be that family, friends, workplace, local community, broader networks, church, political party, country, online, charities, etc..</p>,<p>Today's world is often seen to resolve more and more around individuals, but none of us truly strive without the influence of those around us. It has to be the creation of positive, peaceful communities with open arms on inclusion that the world will become a better place.</p>,<p>Sport to me always creates a positive community even if for the shortest time in cases. Running a marathon (or something a little more manageable!) creates a community of people focused on achieving something amazing for a few hours. It doesn't matter if you win the race as long as you perform to the standard you want to, or even just finish! What does matter is that for a short few hours (using the London Marathon as an example) 35,000 people are focused on the same goal, with their own 2 feet, with millions of supporters, and in this case raising money and profiles of hundreds of charities.</p>,<blockquote>The positive energy, created through serious effort, during a race like this is palatable and with the wonders of internet and television that energy passes along to more and more people.</blockquote>]]></description>
