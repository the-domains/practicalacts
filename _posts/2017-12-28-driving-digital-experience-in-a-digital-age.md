I was delighted to sit down and discuss Digital Transformation with Kim Massana, Global Head of Customer Experience at Thomson Reuters, at Salesforce's annual customer conference, [Dreamforce][0], on November 8th, 2017\. The overall theme of the conference was to discover a whole world of innovation that will transform customer success and we called our breakout session [Driving Customer Experience in a Digital Age][1].

[Link to the video][2]

I started us off with some context on how difficult it is to drive successful digital transformations. We talked about the Salesforce definition of a customer company and how Thomson Reuters is a real trailblazer customer company. A customer of Salesforce for many years, Thomson Reuters is truly Led by higher purpose; Obsessed with Customer Success; and Scaled by flow.

With the context complete we dived into the real story of the day and talked about seven key methods to the successful acceleration we've seen:

* Foundational Investments
* Customer at the center
* One brand, responsive, user experience
* Working in Partnership
* Agile ways of working
* Innovation, Experimentation, Digital Studio
* Managed Change - Customer and business readiness
