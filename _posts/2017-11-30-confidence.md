# Confidence

A recent copy of (Volume 28) [London Business School Review][0] has a great series of six articles on confidence in an uncertain world.

> Confidence is the right that we grant ourselves to become the person of our choosing. Jules Goddard

1. Fault lines - will nationalism threaten Europe's growing financial recovery?
2. The art of confidence - how to resist the expectations of others and become the creation of your own imagination
3. Beware the power paradox - being ruthless is not necessarily the best way to climb the corporate ladder
4. Massage the ego - recognising the different types of narcissist can help you get the tough jobs done
5. Are you sure? - self-belief is healthy as long as you don't live in a bubble
6. In favour of forecasting - why making any policy decisions means trying to predict future trends

Well worth reading.
