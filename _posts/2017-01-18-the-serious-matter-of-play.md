# The serious matter of play
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/45909f9a-7064-4dc3-9703-df4e13dbbf19.png)

We tend to think of play as a child's territory but we loose a lot by thinking just that. Play is a part of life that drives innovation, stimulates communities, helps us enjoy life... to name but a few things.

So a question... do you play enough? Like a child plays? With others? To explore and discover? To have fun? To get to know people? To learn a new skill? To test a new idea? To try something... just because?

I'll bet you don't. Why not?

**Here's some other reading on this subject...**

_From TED.COM:_

A pioneer in research on play, **[Dr. Stuart Brown says][0]** humor, games, roughhousing, flirtation and fantasy are more than just fun. Plenty of play in childhood makes for happy, smart adults -- and keeping it up can make us smarter at any age.

**[John Hunter puts all the problems of the world on a 4'x5' plywood board ][1]**-- and lets his 4th-graders solve them. At TED2011, he explains how his World Peace Game engages schoolkids, and why the complex lessons it teaches -- spontaneous, and always surprising -- go further than classroom lectures can.

At TEDxBG in Sofia, **[Steve Keil fights the "serious meme"][2]** that has infected his home of Bulgaria -- and calls for a return to play to revitalize the economy, education and society. A sparkling talk with a universal message for people everywhere who are reinventing their workplaces, schools, lives.

_From a few interesting connections:_

Kevin Carroll: Finding your own "**[red rubber ball][3]**" and chasing it to your heart's content, he argues, is the surest route to peace, prosperity, and happiness

**[Right to Play][4]**: To improve the lives of children in some of the most disadvantaged areas of the world by using the power of sport and play for development, health and peace.
