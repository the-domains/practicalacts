Investing (for Share, for Product, for Interest) in organisations that are driving for positive, transformational, impact.

## For Share: Equity Investments

Supporting businesses who are trying to change the equilbrium in the market their products and services support. Direct, through AngelList, through www.CrowdCube.com, and through some mixed EIS funds.

* ChronoBank.io: Blockchain revolution in the recruitment industry.
* Cocoon.life: developing home security without the hassle.
* EIS funds supporting small studio movies, micro energy production and heat exchange, solar power development, and smart metering.

Investing in start ups is definitely with risk of no return! However, transformational change doesn't come without taking calculated risks!

## For Product: Kickstarter Support

Supporting creativity and creative projects through www.kickstarter.com. A few examples of what's caught my eye:

* Airblock: The modular and programmable starter drone.
* We the People: public art for the inauguration and beyond.

It's investing with no financial return but cool products to play with in the shorter term! Those that fly (please excuse the Airblock pun!) have the opportunity to move to the next stage of investments or serve a need in the one off, if that's appropriate.

## For Interest: Lending Support

Supporting small sustainable businesses through small loans. Mainly using www.kiva.org and www.lendahand.com. 

Examples:

* SimGas Kenya, a triple bottom line company that designs, produces and installs biogas systems for small holder farmers in East Africa.
* Kindo Ramadhani: Home Energy: Tanzania 
* Impact Hub Accra: Services: Ghana
* Alice: Home Energy: Kenya 
* 17 Quarter - 3: Butcher Shop: Myanmar (Burma)
* Mariama S Group: Food Market: Sierra Leone 
* Simusolar Incorporated: Renewable Energy Products: Tanzania 
* Ah Pyaung Ywar -- 2 Village Group: Food Production/Sales: Myanmar (Burma)

Small loans often seem immaterial but to the recipients can enable a breakthrough in delivery.
