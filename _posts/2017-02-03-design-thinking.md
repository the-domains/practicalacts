I've had the opportunity over the last year to study Design Thinking more formally and leveraged some wonderful courses through IdeoU ([Leading for Creativity][0]) and LinkedIn learning ([Design Thinking: Lead Change in Your Organisation][1] by Frog; [Nathan Shedroff on Design Strategy and the Merging of Business and Design][2] by Lynda.com).

It's stuck me how important building and leveraging design thinking is in today's ever changing world. The core of the learning for me was on how much there is a process to creativity and that there is hope, even for a engineer like me, for us all to become more creative in our workplaces.

There's a great article on [Design Thinking available on HBR][3] right now and do check out the courses I've linked above. **The time invested is worth it.**

Anyone who comes up with new ideas for a living will recognize the challenges this truism presents.</p></article>
