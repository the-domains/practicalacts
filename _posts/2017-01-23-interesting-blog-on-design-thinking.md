  Last spring, Xavier University students used Batterii to ideate, research and
  prototype, eventually building a prosthetic for a three-legged service dog,
  Tiny. The student-led innovation project was another success story for
  Xavier's Center for Innovation (CFI), an on-campus idea and innovation
  incubator that helps students and the region's community drive problem
  solving, renovation innovation, and transformational innovation.
