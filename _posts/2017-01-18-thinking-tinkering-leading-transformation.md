* **Thinking** because understanding, setting, and communicating vision and goals is a critical part of leading organisations that maximise their impact. Jump straight into doing and a whole lot of wasted effort could occur... if you're climbing the wrong hill. To quote Alvin Toffler: _"You've got to think about big things while you're doing small things, so that all the small things go in the right direction."_

* **Tinkering** because reality is never quite as we foresee it. While we all love to think we start with a well defined set of goals and a good plan it is only in our experimentation, failure, iteration, looking for marginal gains, and sometimes wholesale adaptation of the plan along the way that we maximise our impact. As Matthew Syed pitches in his wonderful book, [Black Box Thinking][0]: _"Until we change the way we think about failure, the ambition of high performance will often remain a mirage."_

* **Leading Transformation** because maximising performance and impact needs leadership. Leadership that has a good moral compass, leadership that is passionate about the vision and the people involved, leadership that is willing to fail and learn, leadership that embraces change for good. To quote Jack Welch _"Good business leaders create a vision, articulate the vision, passionately own the vision, and relentlessly drive it to completion."_
