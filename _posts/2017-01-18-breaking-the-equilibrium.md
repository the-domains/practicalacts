A system of action can and often will produce a relatively stable equilibrium that is unpleasant and unproductive for some of these actors, typically for the most underprivileged and marginalised.

Unlike the equilibrium of the glass and pivot in the picture most human and societal equilibriums are really tough to break. This is true within organisations undergoing transformation from the equilibrium of "this is the way things are done around here" and in society at large.

Transformation is hard... but the eventual outcomes are worth every effort.
