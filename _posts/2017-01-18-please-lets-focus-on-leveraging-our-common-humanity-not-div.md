Like many, I suspect, I've been confused and frustrated with the debates on the UK's membership of the EU. I don't like most of either sides arguments.

_**Of all the issues we have in this world and country I am not even sure how this EU debate has made it to the top of the list?**_

Surely in a troubled world the organisations that we belong to together are the most precious we have? Rather than focusing on the flaws of diverse groups trying to work together should we not be focusing on the education and experience we need to develop in the people who try and make them work?

It is easy to criticise organisations like the EU and UN for not doing enough or not doing things in the way we would like them. Are we not being hypocritical though? We're as much responsible as the next country for not getting the returns we would like, we're in these organisations. We are responsible for getting them to work and, more than that, we should be proud of our opportunity to show leadership within them.

Instead of millions of Â£s and hours being spent agonising over division in many areas of the world today can we please focus on getting our organisations to work for the real issues humanity has: poverty, displacement, energy access, war & insurgency, etc

_**Diversity drives great things. Please let's celebrate it and embrace it not run away from it.**_
