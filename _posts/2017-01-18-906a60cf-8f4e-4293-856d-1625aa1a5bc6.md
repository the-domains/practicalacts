  “It's no accident, I think, that tennis uses the language of life. Advantage,
  service, fault, break, love, the basic elements of tennis are those of
  everyday existence, because every match is a life in miniature. Even the
  structure of tennis, the way the pieces fit inside one another like Russian
  nesting dolls, mimics the structure of our days. Points become games become
  sets become tournaments, and it's all so tightly connected that any point can
  become the turning point. It reminds me of the way seconds become minutes
  become hours, and any hour can be our finest. Or darkest. It's our choice.” 

  ― Andre Agassi, Open
