Pledge 1% is an easy way to leverage a portion of your future success to support nonprofits in your community. It''s a small commitment today that can make a huge impact tomorrow.</p></article>

## Why Pledge?

Companies and their employees today want to be civically minded and aligned with a social mission that prioritizes having a positive impact on the world.

Taking the 1% pledge helps companies and individuals demonstrate their philanthropic intent and hold themselves accountable for turning a pledge into action.

## How Does Pledge 1% Work?

[Pledge1percent.org][3] has been built to enable companies and individuals to learn more about how to create a culture of giving through resources, case studies, and best practices. The website also enables visitors to pledge equity, employee time and/or product directly on the site. Pledge 1% staff facilitate making an equity pledge easy to implement, connect companies with local resources to empower employee engagement programs, and help companies to further define and respond to community needs.

## Who Benefits from the Pledges?

Pledgees choose the cause, focus area and nonprofits to receive the realized value of their resources based on their community goals and company and employee interests. The Pledge 1% movement is fully funded by its founding partners, so all realized benefit from pledges goes to the causes that pledgees support. Companies are able to make an optional donation to Pledge 1% upon exit, but this is an optional donation and not a requirement for engagement.
