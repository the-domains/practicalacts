description: >-
  Earth's temperature depends on the balance between energy entering and leaving
  the planet's system. When incoming energy from the sun is absorbed by the
  Earth system, Earth warms. When the sun's energy is reflected back into space,
  Earth avoids warming. When absorbed energy is released back into space, Earth
  cools.
